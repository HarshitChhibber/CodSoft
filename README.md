# CodSoft Internship

I am currently working on a series of Python projects as part of my internship with CodSoft. These projects demonstrate my understanding of fundamental programming concepts, problem-solving ability, and application of Python in real-world scenarios.

Projects Included
- Calculator
- Contact Book
- Password Generator
- Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
- To-Do List (CLI-Based Task Manager)

Each project focuses on building functionality using core Python features, and some also explore file handling, user interaction, and basic logic implementation.
